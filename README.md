Ride Share Simulator: Graph Ed.
---------------------

This is a practice project intended to refamiliarize myself with python OOP, data structures, and algorithms.
Specifically, I will be using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to allow our Car class to calculate the best route to its riders and their destinations.

Map Data Format: The map.csv should contain three columns: start_node, end_node, and travel_time. Each row represents a directed road (an edge) between two locations (nodes) with an associated travel time (weight).

How to Run:
1) Clone the repository
2) Tweak map.csv as desired according to the above format
3) Comment out "Coordinate Ver" code and uncomment "Graph Ver" code in simulation.py
4) Run 'python3 simulation.py'

Dependencies: None

Nearest Neighbor: Quadtree Implementation
------------------------------------------
In the ride share simulator we will eventually select the closest car pick up a rider.
To do so, we will be utilizing Quadtrees to find the nearest neighbor or "car" based on a rider's coordinates.
By using Quadtrees to exponentially shrink our search area for the nearest neighbor, our search algorithm will perform at a O(logN) complexity versus a brute forced O(N) solution.

How to Run:
1) Clone the repository
3) Run 'python3 test_quadtree.py'

Dependencies: None

Ride Share Simulator: Coordinate Ed.
---------------------

This protoype uses a simple open coordinate grid to showcase our simulator's event handler.
A number of riders will request rides with a number of cars on grid at designated timestamps.
If the closest car is available at the time of their request, they will get picked up, and taken to their destination.
Else, they must make a new request and wait for another car to be the closest and be available.

How to Run:
1) Clone the repository
4) Run 'python3 simulation.py'
