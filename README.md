Ride Share Simulator: Graph Ed.
---------------------

This is a practice project intended to refamiliarize myself with python OOP, data structures, and algorithms.
Specifically, I will be using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to allow our Car class to calculate the best route to its riders and their destinations.

Map Data Format: The map.csv should contain four columns: node_id, start_node, end_node, and travel_time. Each row represents a directed road (an edge) between two locations (nodes) with an associated travel time (weight).

How to Run:
1) Clone the repository
2) Tweak city_map_50.csv as desired according to the above format
4) Run 'python3 graph.py'

Dependencies: None

Nearest Neighbor: Quadtree Implementation
------------------------------------------
In the ride share simulator we will eventually select the closest car pick up a rider.
To do so, we will be utilizing Quadtrees to find the nearest neighbor or "car" based on a rider's coordinates.
By using Quadtrees to exponentially shrink our search area for the nearest neighbor, our search algorithm will perform at a O(logN) complexity versus a brute forced O(N) solution.

How to Run:
1) Clone the repository
3) Run 'python3 test_quadtree.py'

Dependencies: None

Ride Share Simulator
---------------------

This protoype uses a simple open coordinate grid to showcase our simulator's event handler.
Riders will continuously request rides with a number of cars on grid at random timestamps.
If the closest car is available at the time of their request, they will get picked up, and taken to their destination.
Else, they must make a new request and wait for another car to be the closest and be available.
The simulation will continue until the specified max_riders

How to Run:
1) Clone the repository
2) Tweak city_map_50.csv as desired according to the previously mentioned format or comment out the 50-node preset in simulation.py's main() and uncomment the 1000-node preset for a larger data experience
3) You may also tweak MEAN ARRIVAL TIME in simulation.py to affect request frequency
4) Run 'python3 simulation.py --max_riders {enter number here}'
